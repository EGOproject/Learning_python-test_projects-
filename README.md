   <h2>The EGO Guessing game 1.3 </h2>
     <p> --This can help beginners to practice defining functions, while loops, if statements, and use of the random module--
     <br> --This is a guessing game with two modes now--
      <br>--The user inputs the rounds they want play, the range and then starts guessing the number the  computer randomly picks from the range. When the round are done,the game ends--
      <br>--The computer mode allows users to test the computer while guessing their number--
      <br>--there is a key at the bottom of the code for anyone who wants to interprte the code--
      <br><u><b>To try out the game use the exe file or download here https://github.com/EGOproject/Learning_python-test_projects-/raw/main/EGO%20Guessing%20game.exe</b></p>
    
   <h2> The EGO RPS game 1.1 </h2>
      <p>--This can help beginners to practice defining functions, while loops, if statements, and use of the random module which includes making a computer make achoice 
         from a list of choices--
      <br>--This is the popular rock paper and scissors game computerized into a python program
      <br>--users input their choice to be compared with the computers choice. The winner is declared in each round--
      <br>--However it inludes a dice roll game in the same logic where the computer randomises the choices from 6 dice digits and declares a win, lose or a tie in any case.
      <br>--there is a key at the bottom of the code for anyone who wants to interprte the code--

   <h2> *The EGO Hangman game 1.1*</h2>
      <p>--This can help beginners to practice importing self made libraries, making lists and sets "as arrays"--
      <br>--Users are require to guess a random word by spelling it out character by character.--
      <br>--There is a limit of lives for invalid input and points are awarded to after the right spelling is guessed--
      </p>
   
   <h2> The list compiler </h2>
      <p>--This can help leaners advance in defining functions, looping and importing inbuilt modules like time among others--
      <br>--The user is reqired to name the list they are compiling and also set the maximum number of items for the list--
      <br>--There is an edit mode used too delet and replace characters but deleting comes first and then replacement after--
      <br>--the final list is then printed after the compilation--

      </p>
   <h2> multiple deriver </h2>
      <p>-- used to derive multiples--
      <br>--learner can use it to practice the above--
      </p>
   
   <h2> continuue.py </h2>
      <p>--This is a continuation module that I have used in the practice projects above--
      <br>--THis can help leaners to practice how to creat modules and importing them--
      </p>
   
   <h2> slot machine </h2>
      <p>--This is being worked upon and anyone can contribute to this--
      <br>--Learners will use it to initiate object oriented programming as we shall be using classes and objects and many other things
      </p>
   
   <h2> easy progress bar </h2>
      <p>--this is a simple progress bar that can be applied and modified in any code basing on desired use--
      <br>--Leaners can go ahead and interact more with the "tqdm" package as well as explore its various features and methods.</p>
