      --This can help beginners to practice defining functions, while loops, if statements, and use of the random module--
      --This is a guessing game with two modes now--
      --The user inputs the rounds they want play, the range and then starts guessing the number the  computer randomly picks from the range. When the round are done, the        game ends--

         from a list of choices--
      --This is the popular rock paper and scissors game computerized into a python program
      --users input their choice to be compared with the computers choice. The winner is declared in each round--
      --However it inludes a dice roll game in the same logic where the computer randomises the choices from 6 dice digits and declares a win, lose or a tie in any case.
