     <p> --This can help beginners to practice defining functions, while loops, if statements, and use of the random module--
     <br> --This is a guessing game with two modes now--
      <br>--The user inputs the rounds they want play, the range and then starts guessing the number the  computer randomly picks from the range. When the round are done,the game ends--
      <br>--The computer mode allows users to test the computer while guessing their number--
      <br>--there is a key at the bottom of the code for anyone who wants to interprte the code--
